### What I learned

I learned working with API and React-router for navigating through pages and utilized the `useParam` and `useSearchParam` to be able to pass data to another page and store values in browser URL, worked with search input and filtering lists and learned a lot.

```html
<button className="flex items-center font-semibold ml-2" aria-pressed="false">
  <!--Learned the accessibility of aria-pressed used for buttons that are expected to have a toggle action -->
</button>
```

```js
    .filter(countryName => countryName.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchCountry && searchCountry.toLowerCase()) || !searchCountry)
    .filter(countryRegion => countryRegion.region.toLowerCase().includes(filterRegion && filterRegion.toLowerCase()) || !filterRegion)
    // Utilized the filter array method to filter out countries by name and filtering regions as well

```

### Continued development

I want to practice using API and transfer data through multiple pages using react-router and improve on working with object arrays and it's methods like `.map` and `.filter`.

### Useful resources

- [Object function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/entries) - Read on Object function and it's methods, good to reference docs often and understanding concepts
- [Filter method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter) - Filter is a very useful array method and MDN docs is great to have an understanding of how things work.
